# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.

# REACT-ROUTER-DOM
`npm i react-router-dom` v6
### wrap the App compo within a BrowsersRouter inside index.jsx file, 
``` <BrowserRouter>
      <App/>
    </BrowserRouter>
```
### then inside App component file wrap all the routable components  with in <Routes> and then pass a path and element to <Route>  
``` <Routes>
      <Route path='/' element={<Home/>}/>
    </Routes>
```
### outlet component from react-router-dom
for nested paths you can use outlet,
1. make sure you import Outlet from react-router-dom
2. return Outlet in, if uou put it on top of your component it will be displayed on the dom on the top, and if you put in underneath it will be displayed underneath teh component on the dom
3. make sure to nest your component before you close Route component
```
////// Home component file //////
import { Outlet } from 'react-router-dom';

const Home = () => {
    return (
        <div>
            <Directory/> 
            <Outlet/>
        </div>
    );
}

////// App component file //////
const App =()=> {
  return (
    <Routes>
      <Route path='/' element={<Home/>}>
       <Route path='/shop' element={<Shop/>}/>
      </Route>
    </Routes>
  );
}
```
